ðŸ“Œ Project Description

    A minimal real-time chat application built with Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. Users enter a username, 
    join the chatroom, and exchange live messages. The interface is sleek and responsive, with proper transitions
    between login and chat views.

Features

    Real-time messaging between multiple users

    2Enter username to join the chat

    "Chatroom" heading visible only after joining the chat

    Join/leave notifications

    Exit back to the login screen at any time

    Simple, centered, compact UI

Installation

       1. Clone or download the repository.

Install dependencies:

    npm install express socket.io
Usage

Start the server:
                        
    node server.js
(By default, the server listens on port 3000. Change server.js for a different port.)

Open your browser and go to:

    http://localhost:3000
Join the chat:

    Enter your username.

    Click Join to enter the chatroom.

    The messaging window appears with the "Chatroom" heading, chat input, send, and exit buttons.

Chat with others:

    Messages are visible in real time to all connected users.

    System updates inform users when someone joins or leaves.

How It Works

     Server: Manages user connections, relays chat messages and system updates.

    Client: Switches between login and chat screens; displays messages and user notifications dynamically; communicates via Socket.IO.

Customization

    To change the port, modify the PORT value in server.js.

    To update colors, fonts, or layout, edit public/style.css.

    To add more features (such as chat rooms, emojis, avatars), enhance server.js, code.js, and the relevant HTML.
